REM Oracle Data Collection Script
REM Version: 2.2
REM
REM Version 2.2 Updates (2026-09-10):
REM - Fixed dbSizeTB returning the same (wrong) value for every PDB in a CDB. It was built on
REM   plain dba_segments, which is not container-spanning -- queried from root, every row it
REM   returns is tagged with root's own con_id, so a PDB's con_id filter matched zero rows and
REM   fell back to the null-coalesce 0. Switched to cdb_segments, which is inherently
REM   container-aware (CONTAINERS() itself is not available until 12.2, so it is not used here).
REM - dailyChangeRate's denominator switched from allocated space (v$datafile) to actual used
REM   space (cdb_segments), so it now reflects the pct of real data that changes daily instead
REM   of pct of allocated-but-possibly-empty space.
REM
REM Version 2.1 Updates (2026-09-09):
REM - Adds one rollup row per CDB representing the whole database as a single entity:
REM   con_id=0, conName is just the CDB name (the root's own name without ".CDB$ROOT").
REM   Storage fields are summed across the real PDBs only (excluding CDB$ROOT and
REM   PDB$SEED); dailyRedoSizeTB is copied from the root rather than summed, since the
REM   root already holds the CDB-wide redo total; biggestBigfileGB/GoldenGate/
REM   exadataEnabled use MAX() across root+PDBs; every other column is copied from the
REM   root. This makes con_id=0 consistently mean "one row per database" for both CDBs
REM   and standalone (11g-style) databases.
REM
REM Version 2.0 Updates (2026-09-03):
REM - Output field delimiter changed from comma to a tab character (chr(9)); some collected
REM   values (e.g. LogArchiveConfig, patchLevel) can legitimately contain commas.
REM - Added SET DEFINE OFF so an "&" in a collected value is not treated as a SQL*Plus
REM   substitution-variable prompt.
REM - dbSizeTB, allocated_dbSizeTB, encryptedDataSizeTB, dailyRedoSizeTB (previously
REM   dbSizeMB/allocated_dbSizeMB/encryptedDataSizeMB/dailyRedoSize) now report TB with
REM   6 decimal places instead of MB/bytes.
REM - biggestBigfileGB, bigfileDataSizeGB (previously *MB) now report GB with 6 decimal places.
REM - sgaMaxSizeGB, sgaTargetGB, pgaAggregateTargetGB, physMemoryGB (previously without the
REM   GB suffix) now report GB at full precision instead of raw bytes.
REM - dbSizeTB and allocated_dbSizeTB now coalesce to 0 instead of returning blank for
REM   containers with no visible segments or datafiles, such as PDB$SEED.
